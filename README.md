# Week 6 Final

This Week 6 final was all Javascript.  It was fun yet frustrating to do.  Created a card game playing off War.  A game between two players.  The card with the highest value wins and that player gets a point.  If the cards have the same value, no one wins that round or gets a point.  At the end, the player with the highest points wins.  If draw, no one wins.  Deck is reshuffled and you can play again!
